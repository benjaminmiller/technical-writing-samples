## Platform objects

A guide to commonly used resource types in found in the Mendeley API.


* **Documents**
Documents are the reason Mendeley exists. Documents encapsulate the metadata for journal articles, books, working papers, reports and more. Documents can be found in user libraries or in the crowdsourced Catalog. [More…](#documents)

* **Files**
File are references to media files and contain everything you need to know about a file. Files can be downloaded and uploaded. Files are owned owned by documents and each can have none, one or many files. [More…](#files)

* **Groups**
Groups let users work together and share resources. Groups can be public or private. Groups contain profiles as members, are owned by a profile and can own documents. [More…](#groups)

* **Annotations**
Annotations let users mark up and comment on documents. Annotations can highlight ranges of text or attach sticky notes to a page. Annotations are attached to documents and are owned by user profiles and groups. [More…](#annotations)

The Mendeley API provides access to more objects adding richness to the platform objects above, including *profiles* to combine user account metadata with academic history and *folders* to collate group documents.



<a name="documents"></a>
### Documents
Document objects represent a wide variety of research material including journal articles, books, theses, working papers, reports, conferences, newspaper and magazine articles and web pages. Documents contain metadata detailing the subject matter, external catalog references, the authors and publishing process. Documents representing many diverse sources are described using a single document object: the [document type](#document_types) is declared through the `type` member of document. Documents do not contain the content media data — this data is available through [file](#files) references. Users enhance documents using [annotations](#annotations) to highlight ranges of text or add notes. 

Documents are found in two locations: users' and groups' libraries, and in the crowd-sourced Catalog.  *User documents* and *catalog documents* have small differences depending on the location: users or Mendeley can augment documents with new metadata additions.

Moving documents between locations creates a *copy* of the document: each document is only found in a single location. To move a document, your application should copy the existing target document's metadata and create a new document in the destination.

### User Documents
Users create new documents using Mendeley's web and desktop tools or possibly your application. User's documents can be stored in a user's library or in a group the user is a member of. User documents, from a library or group, are accessed through the API resource `/documents`. API requests can create, edit and remove any user documents the authorized user has permission to access. 

User documents differ from catalog documents because they can be:

* edited, created and removed
* linked with media content files
* annotated with notes or highlights and tagged
* added to, and removed from, [groups](#groups) and [folders](#folders)

### Catalog documents:
Catalog documents are found in the Mendeley crowdsourced Catalog and are the starting point for building a personalized research collection. Catalog documents are public, read-only and shared between all users – API requests can search and retrieve catalog documents. 

Searching and fetching from the catalog is  possible through two API resources:

* Metadata searches using terms from the document title, abstract, author names or year of publication use  the `/search/catalog` API resource.
* Mendeley identifier or external scheme identifier fetches using types such as DOI, ISBN or Scopus  use the  `/catalog` API resource.

Readership statistics are available for catalog documents because they are public and shared between users. Statistics include the number of readers, their country locations, academic status and discipline. See the sample code [Readership Locations](../code/sample_code.html#readership_locations) for an example using catalog document statistics.
 
Catalog documents differ from user documents because they:

* are read-only
* can be requested using the client credentials OAuth flow
* have reading statistics aggregated from all Mendeley users
* have lower default and maximum values for paged result sets in API responses


### External Identifier Schemes 
Many documents may already exist in a number of recognized external catalogs: many papers include a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), books an ISBN and magazines and journals an ISSN.  All documents may optionally have a number of identifiers for external schemes. A catalog document can be fetched, from an external identifier, using the `/catalog` API resource.

Supported external schemes are:

* [DOI](http://www.doi.org) is a system, managed by the International DOI Foundation, for assigning permanent identifiers to digital resources.
* [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org) is an archive, maintained by Cornell University, for research in the field of physics, mathematics, computer science and statistics. 
* [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) is a database of biomedical literature and research in life sciences.
* [ISBN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) is the International Standard Book Number assigned to all commercially published books 
* [ISSN](http://www.issn.org) is the International Standard Serial Number assigned to a journal or magazine.
* [Scopus](http://www.scopus.com)  is a database of abstracts and citations from peer-reviewed literature.

The supported external schemes can be retrieved using the API's [`document_identifiers`](#document_identifiers) resource. See the sample code [`identifier_catalog_search.rb`](../code/sample_code.html#identifier_catalog_search) for an example using external scheme identifier types.

### Views
Each document contains a wealth of metadata applicable to a diverse range of source documents. Delivering and parsing such a volume of data can be resource intensive and potentially not neccessary in your application. To reduce network load times and memory footprint, your application can request just the set of JSON members in the response it needs  by using the `view` field in the request's HTTP query string:
    
    GET /documents?view=client
    
    GET /search/catalog?view=stats

Not specifying a value for `view` returns the core members of a document. Five values represent the sets of *additional* JSON object members available to  document requests:

<dl>
<dt><code>bib</code><dt>
<dd><em>Bibliographic</em> metadata includes the location within a larger publication, publishing process and publication date. Available to all document responses.</dd>
<dt><code>client</code><dt>
<dd><em>Client application</em> metadata to assist tracking a document's reading and user engagement status and populate a user interface. Available to all documents but richer metadata is available for user documents.</dd>
<dt><code>tags</code><dt>
<dd><em>Tags</em>  are added by users from personal taxonomies to classify a document. Only available to user documents.</dd>
<dt><code>stats</code><dt>
<dd><em>Statistics</em> metadata includes the number of readers, their country locations, academic status and discipline. Only available to catalog documents.</dd>
<dt><code>all</code><dt>
<dd><em>All</em> available metadata will be included in the response.  Available to all document responses.</dd>
</dl>

### Common tasks

* [Determine if a document for a PDF file exists within the Mendeley catalog](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#document_file_in_catalog)


<a name="files"></a>
### Files

File objects in the API are references to media resources attached to documents. Files contain metadata about a media file but do not contain the file's text or binary contents — although, using the API, it is possible to download files.

A file is always associated with a document. Creating a file requires an existing document reference and removing a document also removes all the files attached to the document. A document can have none, one or many files attached. User documents frequently have one or more file attachments while Catalog documents, for copyright or commercial reasons, often do not have any file attachments. A document can only attach a file once — attempting to re-upload an existing file to a document will generate a `400 Bad Request` response.

File objects frequently represent PDF files but can reference any type of text or binary file. Your application *should* favor PDF files as this format provides the greatest opportunities for interoperability and cooperation with the platform and other applications. The API will not alter or change the media file your application uploads and an exact byte-for-byte duplicate will be available through the API.

### Common tasks

* [Checking if a document has a file attached](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#file_document_has_file)
* [Download a media file](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#file_download)
* [Upload a media file](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#file_upload)
* [Updating a file object](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#file_update)


<a name="profiles"></a>
### Profiles
Profiles are the Mendeley users. Profiles combine personal characteristics with education, discipline and employment metadata. Profiles have have names, email addresses, web links and portrait photos, and can own documents and groups. Each profile combines:

* *personal information* including given and family names, email addresses and personal or professional web page links
* *portrait or avatar image* uploaded by the user, scaled and cropped into three different sizes 
* *location* coordinates and English language place name
* *academic status and discipline* values chosen from controlled vocabularies
* *education history* listing previous courses and qualifications achieved by the user
* *professional history* listing employment positions held by the user

The API can be used to request the authorized user profile and profiles for members of Groups. The API can be used to show the currently "logged-in" user and display group membership within a client application. Profiles can not be created, edited or removed using the API, including the profile representing the authorized user. Profiles can not be discovered outside of the authorized user's existing circle of contacts.

Profiles use values from the [disciplines](#disciplines) platform object to define a user's academic discipline and values from the [academic_statuses](#academic_statuses) platform object to define the current academic status. 


<a name="groups"></a>
### Groups

Groups let profiles work together and share resources. Groups have metadata that describes and identifies the group including a name, description and image. There are three types of group: 

* **Private** groups are not listed in Mendeley search results. Private groups are the only groups able to share files. Users in a group are also able to share document references. Private groups are best suited for privately sharing files. A private group has a value of `private` for the `access_level` member.
* **Invite-Only** groups are listed in Mendeley search results and group activity is publicly listed on the Mendeley web site. Users are able to join the group on invitation from the group's administrators. Users are able to share document references but not files. Invite-only groups are best suited for privately sharing reading and reference lists. An invite-only group has a value of `invite_only` for the `access_level` member.
* **Open** groups are listed in Mendeley search results and group activity is publicly listed on the Mendeley web site. Users are freely able to join open groups. Users are able to share document references but not files. Open groups are best suited for widely sharing reading lists. An open group has a value of `public` for the `access_level` member.

Groups can have an owner, administrators, members and followers. Each is represented by a [profile](#profiles) or collection of profiles. The current authorized user's role within a group can be determined by inspecting the `role` member of a group in an API response.

* **Owner**s of groups are a single user profile. Often this is the profile that created the group initially but a profile may receive ownership as part of a transfer process. Disk space for group document storage is allocated against the owner's account. Owners can create administrators and can transfer ownership to another profile. Owners can remove profiles from a group. The value of `role` is `owner` if the current authorized user is the owner of the group.
* **Administrators** are a collection of profiles within a group. Administrators can create administrators from existing members. Administrators can remove profiles, except the owner, from the group and can reduce the role of a profile within the group.  The value of `role` is `admin` if the current authorized user is an administrator of the group.
* **Members** are a collection of profiles within a group. Members can contribute documents and files to private groups and documents to invite-only and open groups.  The value of `role` is `member` if the current authorized user is a member of the group.
* **Followers** are a collection of profiles within a group. Only invite-only and open groups have followers. Followers effectively have read-only access to the group and can not contribute documents. The value of `role` is `follower` if the current authorized user is a follower of the group.

The owner of a group can be identified using the `owning_profile_id` member of a group API response. Group membership size is limited by the owner's subscription. 

Groups can not be created, edited or removed using the API and group membership can not be changed using the API. Groups and membership should be managed using the Mendeley web and desktop applications.

Groups can have documents submitted by owners, administrators and members. Private groups can contain files for the documents. Documents and files are available to all members of the group. Documents can be added to groups using the `POST /documents/{id}` request and specifying a `group_id` member in the body. Documents can be removed from a group using a `DELETE /documents/{id}` request.



### Common tasks

* [Get documents for a group](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#group_get_documents)
* [Add a document to a group](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#group_add_document)
* [Find the owner of a group](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#group_find_owner)



<a name="annotations"></a>
### Annotations

Users mark up documents and files using annotations. Three types of annotations are available.

* **Notes** are scoped to *documents* and provide a high-level comments using styled text. Only a single note annotation can be attached to a document and subsequent attempts to create further note annotations will fail. Note annotations have a value of `note` for the member `type`.
* **Highlights** are scoped to *files* and highlight text ranges or elements on the page. Highlight annotations are located by their bounding rectangles within a page. Highlight annotations have a value of `highlight` for the member `type`.
*  **Sticky notes** are scoped to *files* and provide the ability to attach short, plain text notes to elements on a page. Sticky notes have location within a page. Sticky note annotations have a value of `sticky_note` for the member `type`. 

Annotations are removed when the parent resource is removed. Removing a file, removes all the highlight and sticky note annotations. Removing a document, removes all the annotations. 

The author of an annotation is recorded in the `profile_id` member.  Annotation collections for a particular document, a group's documents or the authorized user can be requested through the API using identifiers included in the request's HTTP query string.

### Rendering and styles
Highlight and sticky note annotations have a location on a page. The location is defined by the bounding rectangle and coordinates are available for the top-left and bottom-right. Sticky note annotations must have zero dimensions so use the same point for the top-left and bottom-right corners. Coordinates units are typographic points and are measured from the origin located in the *lower-left* corner of the page.

The Mendeley Desktop application supports rich text styling of note annotations using inline markup. Styles are available to italicize, set bold weight, underline and set the alignment of text in paragraphs. All annotations have a `color` member enabling your application to set an RGB (8 bits per channel) color value to use as a background or highlight color. The Mendeley applications do not *currently* use the color value but your application should be aware this value may appear and be editable in the future.

### Annotations on group documents
Documents in groups can be annotated. Your application can create or edit note, highlight and sticky note annotations on documents in groups for authorized users who are group members. 
All group members can update a document's note annotation. API requests can update and remove highlight and sticky note annotations created by the authorized user.

Annotation visibility, on all documents not only group documents, is determined by the  `privacy_level` member. A value of `private` indicates the annotation is only visible to the authorized user and a value of `group` indicates the annotation is visible to all group members. The group member who added a document to a group is able to create personal, invisible annotations by supplying `private` as the value for `privacy_level` when creating an annotation using the API. 

Your application should remember to copy annotations appropriately when duplicating documents. Note annotations should accompany a document when copied from a user's library to a group. User's highlight and sticky note annotations *must* not be copied or made available to the group members.

 



<a name="folders"></a>
### Folders

Folders help users organize and group collections of documents. Folders can be created, edited, moved and removed using the API. Folders can contain documents and other folders.

Folder names can contain any Unicode characters (from the Basic Multilingual Plane) up to a maximum length of 255 characters. Folder names are required to create a folder and must be unique within the container. 

Folders can belong to a user's library or a group. Folders in a group can be created by members of the group and are available to members of the group. Folders are listed for a group, or created in a group, by including a value for `group_id` field in the HTTP query string for an API request.

Folders can contain [documents](#documents). A folder is not an exclusive location and documents contained in a folder will be available through API resources `/folders/{id}/documents` and `/documents`. A document can appear in many folders within a library or group. Removing a folder, does not remove the documents contained in the folder, or any child folders. After removing a folder, the previously contained documents will be available through the user's library or group.

Folders can contain other folders, and they in turn can contain other folders. Folder hierarchy is maintained by a folder's link to a parent using a `parent_id` member value. Folders located in the root level do not have a value for the `parent_id` member.  Editing the value for the `parent_id` member changes the folder's position in the hierarchy. Removing a folder, also removes all descendent child folders in a cascading manner. 

### Common tasks

* [Create a folder inside an existing folder](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#folder_create_in_folder)
* [Create a folder in a group](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#folder_create_in_group)
* [Move a folder into another folder](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#folder_move)
* [List the child folders of a folder](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#folder_list_child)
* [Move a child folder to the root level](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#folder_to_root)


<a name="trash"></a>
### Trash

Trash, as the name implies, is a location for documents that are no longer required. Trash can be used to provide users with a chance to reconsider document removal before the document is permanently deleted. Trash is used by Mendeley desktop, mobile and web applications but API requests can remove documents from users' libraries or groups directly. 

Trash is a separate location for documents. Documents in Trash do not appear in responses to requests for other resources and manipulation of documents in Trash must be made using the `/trash` API resource. Documents can be moved into and out of Trash. 

### Common tasks

* [Move a document to Trash](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#trash_in)
* [Remove a document from Trash](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#trash_out)



<a name="document_types"></a>
### Document types

Document types are a controlled vocabulary for a document's `type` member. Document types can represent journal articles, books, working papers, magazine articles reports and many more.
As a reference resource, document types are read-only and can not be edited by the API. Document types, being a reference resource, can be fetched using an access token from any OAuth authorization flow.Document types can not be created, updated or deleted using the API. API responses return the entire collection of documents types in response to a request for `/document_types`.

Each value is accompanied by a *US English* description of the term and this description is suitable for populating user interface controls.
Your application should use the results of `GET /document_types` to present users with a choice of types for a document and not rely on hard-coded lists of values. Your application can then take advantage of future document type additions without an app update.

### Common tasks

* [Populate user interface controls for with document types](../getting_started/common_tasks.html#doc_types_populate_ui)


<a name="identifier_types"></a>
### Identifier types

Identifier types are a controlled vocabulary listing the set of external identifier schemes available to the API. See [Document: Identifiers](#document_identifiers) above. As a reference resource, identifier types are read-only and can not be edited by the API. Identifier types, being a reference resource, can be fetched using an access token from any OAuth authorization flow. Identifier types can not be created, updated or deleted using the API. Controlled vocabularies are most useful as a set, so the API returns the entire collection in response to a request to fetch the values. The collection is not expected to change frequently or expand significantly.

Each value key is accompanied by a *US English* description of the term and this description is suitable for populating user interface controls.
Your application should use the results of `GET /identifier_types` to present users with a choice of identifiers for a document and not rely on hard-coded lists of values. Your application can then take advantage of searching for documents future, new identifier types without requiring an app update.

See the sample code [`identifier_catalog_search.rb`](../code/sample_code.html#identifier_catalog_search) for an example using identifier types to populate a user interface.


<a name="disciplines"></a>
### Disciplines
Disciplines are a controlled vocabulary listing academic disciplines to define a user *profile*'s area of study. As a reference resource, disciplines are read-only and can not be edited by the API. Disciplines, being a reference resource, can be fetched using an access token from any OAuth authorization flow. Disciplines can not be created, updated or deleted using the API. Controlled vocabularies are most useful as a set, so the API returns the entire collection in response to a request to fetch the values.

Discipline values are *British English* language values. Each discipline is accompanied by a list of sub-disciplines values to further refine interests using the profile's `subdisciplines` member. 


<a name="academic_statuses"></a>
### Academic statuses
Academic statuses types are a controlled vocabulary for a profile's `academic_status` member. The set is available as *US English* language values. As a reference resource, academic statuses are read-only and can not be edited by the API. Academic statuses, being a reference resource, can be fetched using an access token from any OAuth authorization flow. Academic statuses can not be created, updated or deleted using the API. Controlled vocabularies are most useful as a set, so the API returns the entire collection in response to a request to fetch the values.
