## Why use the platform

The Mendeley platform provides the ability to query metadata about millions of research documents in almost any programming language. Your application can be integrated with the Mendeley experience and contribute to the Mendeley ecosystem. 

A network Application Programming Interface (API) opens the Mendeley platform to third party applications. The API can be used by :

* researchers creating tools for themselves, colleagues or to share with others
* software developers creating commercial applications for sale 

The API is a supported method to automate and extend the Mendeley platform. You can write a script or application to automate repetitive tasks thereby reducing errors. Automation can also reduce the duration of time consuming tasks. You can create a feature that doesn't currently exist in the Mendeley desktop, mobile or web apps. You could create a tool or application to:

* bring data from a previous service into user's Mendeley library
* efficiently process and upload document files, such as PDF or HTML, into a user library automatically extracting data from the media and annotating the documents
* create a workflow with combining Mendeley with other services or APIs, perhaps using a print on demand service to produce books direct from Mendeley
* a tool to monitor reading statistics and popularity of personal documents

Almost any programming language can use the API. [SDKs](../code/sdks.html) are available for popular languages but retrieving and manipulating data can be performed using simple network requests. Read about [how it works](how_it_works.html) to discover the technologies involved.
