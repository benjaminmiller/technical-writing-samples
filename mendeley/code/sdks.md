## SDKs
API software development kits to ease client application development

Mendeley offers Software Development Kits (SDKs) to help you work with the API. We recommend using the SDK if one is available for your target language or platform. Using an SDK frees you from having to write, test and maintain code. In the future, your application will automatically benefit from improvements and additions to the SDKs. You do not have to write functions to support authorization or network connections and the relationship between data objects is maintained by the SDK. 

### Android
Android mobile app developers can get early access to the SDK to easily access collections of API resources. The SDK can easily be built and integrated into an Android project. [Start using the Android SDK](https://github.com/Mendeley/mendeley-android-sdks) 

### Python
The Python SDK manages authorization, connections, resource collections and pagination within a single access point. The Python package can easily be installed using pip. [Start using the Python SDK](https://github.com/Mendeley/mendeley-python-sdk) 

Each Mendeley API SDK is slightly different. The SDKs address the needs of developers on each platform and may prioritize particular resources. Each SDK is a good citizen on it's platform and delivers features, including installation, licensing, documentation and integration in a way that meets platform expectations.

More SDKs are coming soon. If your language isn't supported, you can still easily work with the API through ubiquitous network and data protocols. See [How It Works](../overview/how_it_works.html) for an overview of the technologies involved and if you'd like to see and SDK for your language, please [feedback](/support.html).
